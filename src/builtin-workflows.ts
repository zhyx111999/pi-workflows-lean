 * Shared registry of the built-in workflow patterns

 * into a runnable script (and, where a pattern needs it, an exec context such
 * as web tools). Both entry points a model or user can reach a built-in
 * through — the `/deep-research`-style slash commands (builtin-commands.ts)
 * and the `workflow` tool's `name` input (workflow-tool.ts) — resolve through
 * this one registry, so the two paths can never drift apart and the
 * per-pattern generator scripts are written exactly once.
